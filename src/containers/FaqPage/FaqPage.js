                What is HotPatch?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Great Question! HotPatch is a peer-to-peer platform for people to list and rent space.
              </p>
              <p>
                It allows users and hosts to access and share any space: rental chairs in hair salons, fitness
                studios, offices, and anything else in between!
              </p>

              <br></br>

              <h2>
                How does HotPatch build trust between users and hosts?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Building trust between users and hosts is our number one priority.
              </p>

              <p>
                To achieve that, we have a first-class support system, including a 24-hour direct chat,
                unfiltered review sections, as well as a strong social media presence.
              </p>

              <p>Where do we start?</p>
              <p>Listing and booking through HotPatch protects you under our Terms of Service, cancellation
              and refund policies.</p>
              <p>Additionally, booking and listing through HotPatch means that you will provide and receive a
              review. A review is an important way of building trust and improves the likelihood of being
              chosen to host or access a space.</p>
              <p>And, if that wasn’t enough.... HotPatch uses a dedicated and trusted payment platform
              meaning that all transactions are secure. Using HotPatch means that you are at a lower risk of
              fraud or other security issues!</p>
